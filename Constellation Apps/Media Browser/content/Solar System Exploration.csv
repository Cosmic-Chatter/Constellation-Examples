Ceres.webp,Ceres,NASA/JPL-Caltech/UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA,Robotic,2010s,"NASA’s robotic mission, Dawn, found these bright spots in several craters on the asteroid Ceres. They appear to be deposits of salt left behind from a previous episode of cryovolcanism."
Jupiter.jpg,Jupiter,NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute,Robotic,2000s,"NASA's New Horizons spacecraft captured this image of Jupiter as it flew past on its way to visit Pluto. The shadow of Jupiter’s largest moon, Ganymede, is visible near the top."
Saturn.jpg,Saturn,Robert Hooke,Human,1660s,English scientist Robert Hooke made this drawing of Saturn in 1666 based on his own telescope observations. He was among the first to correctly identify the shadows of both the planet and its famous rings.
Uranus.jpg,Uranus,NASA,Robotic,1980s,NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft captured this image of Uranus during its flyby in 1986.
Neptune.webp,Neptune,NASA,Robotic,1980s,This image of Neptune was captured by NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft as it flew by in 1989. Neptune’s deep blue hue comes from methane in its upper atmosphere.
Pluto.jpg,Pluto,NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute ,Robotic,2010s,This stunning image shows the thin atmosphere of Pluto. It was captured by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft after it passed the dwarf planet.
