# Constellation-Examples
A collection of example data demonstrating the range of uses for Constellation

## Usage
These examples illustrate different ways __**Constellation**__ can be used. They are designed such that everything can be run from a single PC.

To get started, you need to install and run a temporary Control Server once, then close it. After that, copy the files from the Control Server example directory into your Control Server installation. This will set everything up in a consistent way for the examples. Once that's done, you can start Control Server again.

Then, download and run Constellation Apps. Like before, follow the setup wizard and then close the app. At that point, you can copy the files from your desired example into your Constellatino Apps direcory. This should overwrite your `defaults.ini` file and your `content` directory. Start Apps again and visit http://localhost:8000. Chose the app you want to run and everything will start!
